# SwiftLet #05: Closures
_Input and Output_

A Closure is a block of code that can be executed by reference of a variable or name. Closures in Swift are normally unnamed and passed in as a parameter variable or stored as a variable. Functions are named blocks of code, they can also be passed in as a parameter for a Closure type.

**Closure Type**
The most basic Closure type you can have is one that doesnâ€™t take any parameter variables (input) and doesnâ€™t return (output) anything. This Closure type is common and is know as the Void to Void closure.
```swift
let closure: () -> Void
```

The type of this closure denotes that it doesnâ€™t take any parameters, `()`, and returns `Void` which every Closure in Swift, which doesnâ€™t return a specified type, happens to return `Void`. 

Another example for a Closure type could be one that takes in some `Int` and returns some `String`.
```swift
let closure: (Int) -> String

closure = { times in
    String(repeating: "ğŸ§±", count: times)
}

func function(times: Int) -> String {
    String(repeating: "ğŸ§±", count: times)
}

print(closure(3)) // ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±
print(function(times: 3)) // ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±
```

Notice that the function has the same Closure type except that it has a named parameter `(times: Int) -> String`.  To show this we can have another function that has a parameter of `(Int) -> String`.
```swift
let closure: (Int) -> String

closure = { times in
    String(repeating: "ğŸ§±", count: times)
}

func function(times: Int) -> String {
    String(repeating: "ğŸ§±", count: times)
}

func task(closure: (Int) -> String) {
    print(closure(5))
}

task(closure: closure) // ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±
task(closure: function) // ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±ğŸ§±
```
