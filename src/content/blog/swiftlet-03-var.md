# SwiftLet #03: Var
_Var is the keyword to define a variable._

```swift
var variable: String

variable = "ğŸ‘‹"

print(variable) // ğŸ‘‹

variable = "ğŸ˜±"

print(variable) // ğŸ˜±
```

**Example 1**

Some types allow for the use of different operators! So far we have only used the assignment operator (**=**). For this example we will try using the addition operator (**+**). 

```swift
var variable: String

variable = "ğŸ‘‹"

print(variable) // ğŸ‘‹

variable = variable + "ğŸ˜±"

print(variable) // ğŸ‘‹ğŸ˜±
```

**Example 2**

```swift
var variable: [String]

variable = ["ğŸ‘‹"]

print(variable) // ["ğŸ‘‹"]

variable.append("ğŸ¤ª")

print(variable) // ["ğŸ‘‹", "ğŸ¤ª"]
```
