Let's face it, when you are going to start a new iOS project it would be nice if you could have some boilerplate code ready for you to work with. Something that is tested, has necessary features, and is organized in a readable, and concise manner. iOS-base specifically aims to provide developers with an easy-to-use, and easy-to-understand template that can be molded into your needs or used as a guide for building your application.

This template offers navigation, file storage, notifications, local persistence, and data handling including mock and network objects, and even includes tests and test examples. From here, the world is your oyster, and you can move forward to build out a fantastic, testable iOS application.
